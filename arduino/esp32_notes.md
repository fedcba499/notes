## What are ESP32 series modules that include an on-chip USB-to-serial (UART) converter?
- ESP32-C3
- ESP32-C6
- ESP32-S3
- ESP32-H2
These modules do not require an external USB-to-UART bridge (like CP2102 or CH340) for flashing and debugging, as they have a built-in USB interface that supports both serial communication and firmware updates via USB CDC (Communication Device Class).
