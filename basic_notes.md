#What is decorator?
Decorate mean to enhance the appearance of something by adding something unessential.
    Painting building
    Adding lights, screens etc to event

Decorator in Python implies - a function that takes another function as an argument and returns a new function with enhanced functionality.

What is requirement of VIrtual Environments?
The more Python projects you have, the more likely it is that you need to work with different versions of Python libraries, or even Python itself. Newer versions of libraries for one project can break compatibility in another project.
Virtual environments are independent groups of Python libraries, one for each project. Packages installed for one project will not affect other projects or the operating system‚Äôs packages.

what is yaml ?
YAML is to create configuration files. It's recommended that configuration files be written in YAML rather than JSON, even though they can be used interchangeably in most cases, because YAML has better readability (like Python Syntax, white space) and is more user-friendly.

what is epoches ?
In machine learning, an epoch refers to one complete pass through the entire training dataset where every data sample is passed through the model and its parameters are updated based on the calculated error. The training process requires multiple epochs, allowing the model to improve iteratively by adjusting its parameters based on the calculated error.

what are weights?
Purpose: During forward propagation, inputs are multiplied by their respective weights before being passed through an activation function. This influences how strongly each input contributes to the final output. Like, we did in course grading prediction model, where each parameter like (married or unmarried, trade, state etc ) each column or parameter to be multiplied with certain weight based on its influence on final outcome.
Learning Mechanism: During training, weights are updated iteratively through optimization algorithms like gradient descent to minimize the difference between predicted and actual outcomes.
Generalization: Properly tuned weights allow the network to generalize beyond training data making accurate predictions on new, unseen inputs.

Best Practises of Python
Requirements File : It is good method to use requirements file to use for listing dependency library. In future if we want to rerun program we can uses same set of library which were functional.

Virtual Environment - It is good practise to create separate Virtual environment for each project so that has its own dependent library in separate  folder can be added to gitignore.

Version Control - To test and add to Main Brach.

IPython (short for Interactive Python) is an enhanced interactive Python shell designed for interactive computing and exploratory data analysis.

Before training on custom data yonov11n.pt is of size 5.35 mb, after training on aadhar data set size it still the same. Why?
yolov11n.pt - Pretrained weights ‚Äî default weights trained on COCO or another base dataset.
best.pt - Your trained weights ‚Äî same architecture, but learned parameters updated based on your dataset.

Why Size Is Similar
YOLOv11n (nano) has a fixed architecture with ~2.58 million parameters.
So, both files store weights for the same number of layers and tensors.
Only the values of those parameters (weights, biases, batch norms) are different.
This is why both files are ~5.3 MB, but they encode different model behavior.

Think of it like saving two versions of the same Excel sheet ‚Äî same format, different data.

In Aadhar card, licence plate and helmet we are using object detection model.
Yolo can do Object Detection, Instance Segmentation, pose/ keypoints, oriented detection and classification.

üèóÔ∏è Basic Building Blocks
1. Model
model = yolov8n.pt
You are using YOLOv8n, where n stands for nano (small and fast, good for beginners).

.pt is a PyTorch model file. You're starting from a pre-trained model that already knows general shapes.

2. Dataset
data = /content/Helmet-Detection-2/data.yaml
This file tells YOLO where your training and validation images are.

It also lists the names of the objects (like ‚Äúhelmet‚Äù).

3. Training Duration
epochs = 100
One epoch = one full pass through your dataset.

You‚Äôll train for 100 passes to let the model learn better.

4. Image Size
imgsz = 640
All images are resized to 640 x 640 pixels before training.

This keeps the training stable and fast.

5. Batch Size
batch = 16
16 images are processed at a time.

A bigger batch trains faster but uses more memory.

6. Device
device = 0
It means you‚Äôre using the first GPU in your system (GPU index 0).

If you were using CPU, this would be device=cpu.

üé® Data Augmentation
These are tricks used to make more variations of your images to help the model generalize better.

1. auto_augment = randaugment
It automatically applies smart image transformations (like rotating, flipping, etc.).

Helps model handle real-world variations.

2. mosaic = 1.0
Combines 4 training images into one. Helps detect small objects better.

3. translate = 0.1
Randomly moves objects by up to 10% of the image size.

4. scale = 0.5
Randomly zooms in or out on the object.

5. fliplr = 0.5
50% chance of flipping the image left to right.

6. erasing = 0.4
Randomly removes parts of the image to help the model become more robust.

üß† Learning Parameters
These control how the model learns.

1. lr0 = 0.01
Starting learning rate ‚Äî how fast the model adjusts its guesses.

2. momentum = 0.937
Helps smooth the learning over time.

3. weight_decay = 0.0005
Keeps the model from memorizing the training data.

4. warmup_epochs = 3.0
For the first 3 epochs, the model starts slowly before speeding up learning.

üìÇ Saving and Logging
These control what gets saved and where.

1. project = improved_detection
2. name = better_model_v1
Your model and results will be saved under a folder:

improved_detection/better_model_v1/
3. save = True
It saves trained models, graphs, etc.

4. save_dir = improved_detection/better_model_v1
This is the exact folder where your model will be saved.

üß™ Evaluation & Validation
These settings help you test how good your model is.

1. val = True
YOLO will evaluate your model on validation images after each epoch.

2. patience = 20
If the model doesn‚Äôt improve after 20 epochs, it stops training early.

‚ö° Speed Boost Options
1. amp = True
Uses mixed precision training (faster and uses less GPU memory).

2. cache = True
Loads images into memory to speed up training.

3. workers = 8
Uses 8 CPU threads to load data in parallel.

 What is a Quantized Model?
A quantized model is a compressed version of your trained model, where floating point numbers (32-bit) are converted into smaller numbers, like 8-bit integers (int8).

Types of Quantization 
Dynamic Quantization	Only weights are quantized (int8)	Good, fast, easy
Static Quantization	Weights + activations are int8	More accurate but complex
Quantization Aware Training (QAT)	Trained with quantization in mind	Best accuracy, slow to train

For YOLO, dynamic or static quantization is often used after training.

ONNX stands for Open Neural Network Xchange
 It‚Äôs like exporting a Word document as PDF ‚Äî any device can open it the same way.
