## Boards Manager
By default only Arduino AVR boards are installed, we need to add links to have access to esp32, esp8266 and rp2350 boards.
> Espressif System stopped supporting ESP8266, but these are widely available in market and at very low price. Hence, community is supporting ESP8266 board manager.
