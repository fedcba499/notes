## Flight Controller
- SpeedyBee
- Zerodrag (Made in India) https://zerodrag.in/products/zerodrag-nova-f4
- Botlab dynamics (made in India)
- The Dark Matter (https://thedarkmatter.in/)
- Pixhawk

## Firmware
- Betaflight
- INAV (Matak, F4, F7)
- Ardupilot

> Start with ardupilot as it is good with stability of drone, then switch to inav, inav is very easy to configure, then move to betaflight, its is best in class firmware.


## Program Control
Dronekit-Python - Communicating with drone with mavlink.
MAVLink is a light weight messaging library for messaging between drone and ground control station.

Skybrush for Drone light show. Drone light show require 2 cm level accuray, which require rtk corrections. Skybrush live, skybrush server, skybrush blender addon. Mavlink through wifi router messaging with ground control station (GCS) ie laptop. this mavlink protocol is used for sending RTK Corrections.

## Drone Battery Packs
Lithium Ion Battery pack is good for normal drones, (18650 Cells)

Lithium Polymer battery pack is good for faster drones, where power discharge required is maximum.

Volatage Range - 2S to 6S (S stands for Series), 1 Cell has 3.0 to 4.2 Volts. 

Capacity - 6000 mAh, capacity increses with parallel connection group.

4S 1P Battery Pack. 4S 2P stands for 4 cells in series and another 4 Cells in parallel group.

Current Rating - 25 A, how many amps does application pulling.
Higher discharge good for racing drone. 

if we connect in parallel, it doubles amphere or current rating.

Higher current density (capacitance), lesser discharge rate or current rating.

Nickel strips for cell soldering.

Build parallel group first, and then connect in series. parallel group in series.

Imedence matching, resistance matching.


## Radio Controller
Radiomaster Pocket Crush

## Radio Receiver
2.4 G Hz Radio single frequency is good for training purposes.
> Radiomaster pocket - elrs and cc2500 versions

> Radiomaster pocket crush -  comes only in ELRS version.

Radiomaster pocket is powered by 18650 battery cells, instead like Flysky uses AA cells.


### ELRS 
ExpressLRS is opensource radio link based on esp32 or STM32. It supports 900 MHz and 2.4 GHz Frequency.

## ESC
Electronic speed controllers comes with 2 processing power 8 bit processor and 32 bit processor. AM32 is a opensource firmware designed to handle 32 bit powered ESC with STM32 chips.

## Camera
Analog Camera are low cost with little lag but offers low latency
CADDXFPV brand 

## Frames
Carbon fibre frames are good with stability than platic frame drones.

Carbon fibre frames comes in 5 inch, 7 inch and 10 inch sizes.

## Rotors
> Rotor has 2 components, 1. Stator (static and fixed to arm), 2. Rotor (outer moving part). Configuration of rotor has 6015 stands for 60mm diameter of rotor and 15 mm height. magnets are in rotor.
