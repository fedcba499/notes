## Tips & Tricks
- while cloning a repository, clone required branches only, dont clone entire repository, especially, repository with mkdocs scripts. while i trying to push commits to cloud, gh_pages branch continously changes, due to this, git file got corrupted. so clone only main branch and push commits to main branch only.
