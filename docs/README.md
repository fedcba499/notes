## Guidelines

### Filename
Keep filename crisp as well as it should give it essence of its contents. for example, as we are using Notes repository, there is no need to explicitly mention notes in file name.

> Good Practise - micropython

Dont use spaces in file names
> Bad Practise - machine learning basics \
> Good Practise - machine_learning_basics

### Title
Keep Names of Titles crisp
> Bad Practise - What is Refactor? \
> Good Practise - Refactor

### Program
> Constants - Captial (HIGH, LOW, INPUT, BUFFER)
> Classes / Object - UpperCamelCase (Serial, HardwareSerial)
> Functions / Methods - lowerCamelCase (pinMode, digitalRead, analogWrite)
