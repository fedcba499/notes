## Refactor
When we change folder structure or rename files, it associated relative paths also changes, for example when we insert images in markdown files, if we change folder structure, then we need to manually change all path instances where images used. 

Refactor helps in automating naming paths / relative paths / references of files used in entire project. saves lot of time and provide flexilibity to developer for creating better folder structure as project develops.
